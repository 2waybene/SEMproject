# SEMproject


There is a very good example using R for SEM, http://personality-project.org/r/r.sem.html,
But, it does not seem to work


David A. Kenny seems to be an expert on Statistical Modeling and he creates a series of Webinars and online documentation. I would like to give him the credit for preparing this: http://davidakenny.net/webinars/listw.htm#Fit

Bruce A. Craig from Purdue Univeristy also has plenty of resources on SEM and statistical model in general
http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~bacraig/SCS/

I like this USGS help doc by Jim Grace the most: https://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/SEM/

Jarrett E.K. Byrnes posted details slides for the workshop at http://jarrettbyrnes.info/ubc_sem/ , there are slides, examples etc. Very useful

There is a specific website focusing on lavaan package, very thorough. http://www.structuralequations.org/
